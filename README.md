Usage is similar to dirb, with some still missing options

Credit to The Dark Raver for the original dirb project, although nothing has been borrowed from it except the usage text and the option list.

# Setup

You must use composer to fetch dependencies.

`php composer.phar update` or `composer update` in the project root.
